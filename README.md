# criminality-fling
A fling script for [Criminality](https://www.roblox.com/games/4588604953)  
This project started as a way for me to learn lua, when I first started writting it all I knew was `print("Hello World")`, and then I just learnt as I went.  
I'm proud of how far I went with it, i'm much less proud of the code itself.

## [Cube-07 rewrite.lua](https://github.com/Guest257351/criminality-fling/blob/main/Cube-07%20rewrite.lua)
An unfinished rewrite by [itslush](https://github.com/Itslush) that was supposed to fix the spaghetti code created by a 2 year old codebase that was created by someone who didnt even know the language at the time.

## [rayfield.lua](https://github.com/Guest257351/criminality-fling/blob/main/rayfield.lua)
A modified version of the rayfield UI library, fixes some bugs and also adds functionality that was required for autofilling text inputs.  
The loadstring at [guest.gay](https://cdn.guest.gay/libs/rayfield.lua) will remain up for the foreseeable so you don't need to modify any code.
